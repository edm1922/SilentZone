# Firebase to Supabase Migration Status

This document outlines the current status of the migration from Firebase to Supabase in the SilentZone project.

## Completed Tasks

### Database Migration
- [x] Created Supabase database schema for mute rules, filter profiles, and user settings
- [x] Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- [x] Created migration script to transfer data from Firebase to Supabase

### Authentication
- [x] Implemented Supabase authentication context
- [x] Created login and signup components using Supabase Auth
- [x] Added password reset functionality

### API Integration
- [x] Created API routes for mute rules using Supabase
- [x] Implemented authentication for API routes
- [x] Added synchronization endpoint for browser extension

### Browser Extension
- [x] Updated background script to work with Supabase API
- [x] Added authentication UI to browser extension popup
- [x] Created token-based authentication for extension-to-API communication
- [x] Implemented authentication flow in the extension
- [x] Added session handling and token management

## Pending Tasks

### Authentication
- [x] Test authentication flows end-to-end
- [ ] Add social login options (Google, GitHub, etc.)

### Data Migration
- [x] Execute the migration script with real user data
- [x] Verify data integrity after migration
- [ ] Set up data backup procedures

### Browser Extension
- [x] Complete the authentication implementation
- [x] Test synchronization with Supabase backend
- [ ] Update content filtering to work with Supabase data format

### Core Functionality
- [x] Implement keyword management UI
- [ ] Implement platform-specific filtering options
- [ ] Add duration settings for muted content

### Cleanup
- [x] Remove all Firebase dependencies
- [x] Update environment variables
- [x] Update documentation to reflect Supabase usage

## Migration Strategy

1. **Parallel Operation Phase**
   - Both Firebase and Supabase systems are operational
   - New features are implemented in Supabase only
   - Existing features continue to use Firebase

2. **Transition Phase** (Current)
   - Authentication moved to Supabase
   - Data read/write operations moved to Supabase
   - Browser extension updated to use Supabase APIs

3. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Remove all Firebase code and dependencies
   - Update documentation and guides
   - Finalize Supabase-only architecture

## Testing Plan

1. **Authentication Testing**
   - Test user registration
   - Test login/logout
   - Test password reset
   - Test session persistence

2. **Data Operation Testing**
   - Test creating mute rules
   - Test reading mute rules
   - Test updating mute rules
   - Test deleting mute rules

3. **Browser Extension Testing**
   - Test authentication from extension
   - Test data synchronization
   - Test content filtering with Supabase data

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues with the Supabase migration:

1. Revert API routes to use Firebase
2. Restore Firebase authentication context
3. Update browser extension to use Firebase APIs
4. Communicate the rollback to users if necessary

## Next Steps

1. Complete the pending tasks in the order listed
2. Conduct thorough testing of all components
3. Execute the cleanup phase
4. Update the project roadmap to reflect post-migration priorities
