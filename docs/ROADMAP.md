#### Desktop Applications
- [ ] Package web application with Electron
- [ ] Create native desktop features
- [ ] Implement system-level integrations where possible

### Phase 5: Monetization and Growth

#### Freemium Model Implementation
- [ ] Define free vs. premium features
- [ ] Implement subscription management
- [ ] Create premium filter packs

#### Analytics and Improvement
- [ ] Implement anonymous usage analytics
- [ ] Create feedback mechanisms
- [ ] Establish continuous improvement process

## Recent Achievements

1. **Migration to Supabase**
   - Successfully migrated from Firebase to Supabase for authentication and data storage
   - Implemented row-level security for better data protection
   - Enhanced database schema for improved performance and flexibility

2. **Browser Extension Improvements**
   - Reduced sync interval to 10 seconds for near real-time updates
   - Implemented automatic synchronization between web app and extension
   - Added visual feedback for sync status and timing
   - Cleaned up codebase by removing unnecessary debug files

## Technical Challenges

1. **Platform Integration**
   - Working within the constraints of browser extensions
   - Accessing content in mobile applications
   - Maintaining performance while scanning content

2. **Content Detection Accuracy**
   - Minimizing false positives
   - Handling context-dependent content
   - Processing different content types (text, images, videos)

3. **Cross-Platform Synchronization**
   - Ensuring consistent filtering across devices
   - Managing offline capabilities
   - Handling data synchronization efficiently

4. **Privacy and Security**
   - Processing content locally when possible
   - Securing user data and preferences
   - Implementing end-to-end encryption for cloud sync

## Current Focus

The immediate focus is on completing Phase 2 by:
1. Implementing duration settings for muted content
2. Creating platform-specific filtering options
3. Enhancing the dashboard with filtering statistics
4. Implementing platform-specific selectors in the browser extension

## Next Steps

1. Develop the duration settings UI and functionality
2. Implement platform-specific filtering options (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
3. Create a comprehensive analytics dashboard
4. Add override options for temporarily viewing filtered content
5. Optimize extension performance and reliability

## Long-term Vision

SilentZone aims to become the leading content filtering solution across all digital platforms, providing users with a seamless experience to control the content they consume while maintaining privacy and performance.
