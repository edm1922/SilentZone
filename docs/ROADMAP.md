## Technical Challenges

1. **Platform Integration**
   - Working within the constraints of browser extensions
   - Accessing content in mobile applications
   - Maintaining performance while scanning content

2. **Content Detection Accuracy**
   - Minimizing false positives
   - Handling context-dependent content
   - Processing different content types (text, images, videos)

3. **Cross-Platform Synchronization**
   - Ensuring consistent filtering across devices
   - Managing offline capabilities
   - Handling data synchronization efficiently

4. **Privacy and Security**
   - Processing content locally when possible
   - Securing user data and preferences
   - Implementing end-to-end encryption for cloud sync

## Current Focus

The immediate focus is on completing Phase 1 by:
1. Implementing the core keyword management functionality
2. Developing the basic browser extension
3. Establishing communication between the web app and extension
4. Testing the basic filtering capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Complete the keyword management UI in the web application
2. Implement the database schema for storing user preferences
3. Develop the content scanning functionality in the browser extension
4. Test the integration between the web app and extension

## Long-term Vision

SilentZone aims to become the leading content filtering solution across all digital platforms, providing users with a seamless experience to control the content they consume while maintaining privacy and performance.
