# SilentZone Analytics Implementation

This document describes the analytics implementation in SilentZone, which helps track user behavior and application performance.

## Overview

SilentZone uses Firebase Analytics to track user interactions and application usage. The analytics data helps us understand how users are using the application, which features are most popular, and how effective the content filtering is.

## Analytics Events

The following events are tracked in SilentZone:

### User Events

- `user_signup`: When a user creates a new account
- `user_login`: When a user logs in
- `user_logout`: When a user logs out
- `user_profile_update`: When a user updates their profile information

### Mute Rule Events

- `rule_created`: When a user creates a new mute rule
- `rule_deleted`: When a user deletes a mute rule
- `rule_updated`: When a user updates a mute rule
- `rule_applied`: When a rule is applied to mute content
- `rule_overridden`: When a user chooses to see muted content

### Extension Events

- `extension_installed`: When the browser extension is installed
- `extension_uninstalled`: When the browser extension is uninstalled
- `extension_enabled`: When the browser extension is enabled
- `extension_disabled`: When the browser extension is disabled

### Feature Usage

- `ai_suggestion_used`: When a user uses an AI-suggested topic
- `advanced_filter_used`: When a user uses advanced filtering options
- `platform_filter_used`: When a user filters by platform

### Page Views

- `page_view`: When a user views a page

## Analytics Dashboard

The analytics dashboard provides insights into:

1. **Rule Effectiveness**: How often rules are applied and overridden
2. **Platform Distribution**: Which platforms are most commonly filtered
3. **Keyword Frequency**: Which keywords are most commonly used
4. **User Engagement**: How often users create and modify rules
5. **Feature Usage**: Which features are most commonly used

## Implementation Details

### Analytics Service

The analytics service is implemented in `src/lib/analytics.ts` and provides methods for logging various events.

### Analytics Hook

The `useAnalytics` hook in `src/hooks/use-analytics.ts` provides a convenient way to use analytics throughout the application. It automatically tracks page views and provides access to all analytics methods.

### Integration Points

Analytics are integrated at the following points:

1. **Authentication**: Login, signup, and logout events
2. **Mute Rules**: Creation, deletion, and updating of mute rules
3. **Feature Usage**: Usage of advanced filters, platform filters, and AI suggestions
4. **Page Views**: Automatic tracking of page views

## Privacy Considerations

SilentZone takes user privacy seriously:

1. All analytics data is anonymized
2. No personally identifiable information is collected
3. Users can opt out of analytics in their account settings
4. Analytics data is only used to improve the application

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements to the analytics implementation may include:

1. More detailed tracking of rule effectiveness
2. A/B testing of different features
3. User feedback integration
4. Performance monitoring
